Today I will be giving a workshop about Mobile Apps to the fine people of QME (Queen Mary Entrepreneurs).

The workshop will be focused mainly on planning and designing the app. I think we&#8217;ll have to leave the building part for a second part, follow up, or call it as you want, but if we can leave with a clear idea of what the app has to do it will be a success from my part.

As usual, me being me, I&#8217;ve forgotten half of the stuff I wanted to bring and perhaps I should take my lunch and go home to get all the material. Nothing fancy, post-it notes, pencils, and my video adaptor for my laptop O_0 <&#8211; don&#8217;t panic, I have my good old Mac with me, so we&#8217;re safe  <img src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />and yes, a quick trip to Rymans can sort the stationery out.
