Why? really, why?
=================

Let me put it like this&#8230; I stop writing ages ago because I could not find where to do it. I&#8217;ve really tried to write in all the blogs of all my failed projects (and there&#8217;re a few) but I&#8217;ve failed (once more).

I could have returned to my old grabuma blog, but alas, I wanted something more&#8230; not sure, but going back to blogger seemed wrong.

I&#8217;ve been willing to write about several things but I couldn&#8217;t find the place. I even consider the fact of writing yet-another-blogging system&#8230; Enough.

Give me a notebook and my pen: I have to write a bit!
