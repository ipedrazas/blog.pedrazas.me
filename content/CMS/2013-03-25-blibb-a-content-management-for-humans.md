If I talk about CMS everybody who knows the term will think of systems that allow you to manage your on-line assets. Woot? CMS is kind of a horrible term since it&#8217;s wrapped up in many layers of misunderstanding.

CMS is not a web design tool, CMS is not a magic factory to produce websites. CMS systems allow you to manage your content (not your website, do yo see the difference?). Unfortunately for us, humans, there&#8217;s nothing that allow us to manage our online content as consumers.

WordPress is great, suddenly the author of this blog can swap almost any little piece of this blog with a few clicks&#8230; however, the same author is really struggling to manage his bookmarks, rss feeds (now that Google Reader is walking the green mile), pictures, music, and the issue goes on.

Haven&#8217;t you notice? it is your content, but it has turn into their business!

So, let me ask you this: when, as users, did we decide to delegate the responsibility of managing our on-line content on third parties that did whatever they liked / wanted?

Companies that when their time arrived, they left us all by the side of the road looking confused, lost and sad.

I agree, del.icio.us was great.. until they died. Nobody thought that Google would kill Reader but they did and now that uneasy feeling of me delegating my on-line content on third parties is turning into a terrible itch. My on-line resources are part of my business.

I am who I am and I do what I do because of my information.

Reader&#8217;s Assassination is the last straw. My content cannot be left in hands of companies that look at me as their way of making money. Turning Users into a comodity is a high risk game. I agree, not many people will desert all these Free Services (because they are free), but every time you use a free service remind yourself the price you will have to pay to move away. Sometimes, paying is the cheapest way to freedom.

Call me stupid but I&#8217;ve been building a CMS. A different kind of CMS, a CMS that allows me to manage my content. Perhaps it&#8217;s not as sparkly and shiny as all these other services, but look at this: it&#8217;s mine. I have total control over it. My content is nobody&#8217;s business any more.

This CMS is called :blibb and it&#8217;s a bit early to open it up to the masses but if you are interested on trying a very early version just let me know.
