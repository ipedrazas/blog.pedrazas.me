You have an idea, and that&#8217;s great, but now you need time to cook it, and bake it and let it rest, and then look at it again&#8230; Of course you don&#8217;t have time for anything, so, you just go like mad and jump into this new idea because it&#8217;s so great that you cannot understand how nobody has noticed it before, how no one has done anything before &#8230; And then you fail (it&#8217;s not quiet like that but I&#8217;ll save you a few lines of going nowhere).

You have an idea and then you wait, and then you talk to people and explain that idea. You see, my wife was right when she said that if you cannot explain an idea the idea is not that great. But how are you going to explain someone your new idea about quantum physics if nobody knows quantum physics&#8230; and this is the hardest lesson I&#8217;ve learnt these last two years:

If you cannot condense and explain your idea in plain language that everybody can understand, chances are that it&#8217;s not that great idea.

Don&#8217;t get me wrong, the idea can be incredible awesome, but you have to go over and over and over again to polish it off, to make it cristal clear. Then, and only then, it&#8217;s when it makes sense to go wild and try to create whatever your idea is all about.

The beauty of the whole thing is that no matter what, you will learn. Either by failing or by succeeding and that is, I think, the best of the whole situation.
