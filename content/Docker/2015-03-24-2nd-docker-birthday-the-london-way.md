It was a good evening to catch up with friends and of course, a great opportunity to meet new people.

As usual with Docker, the swag was top notch. The mentor&#8217;s t-shirt was especially awesomic!

Beers and pizza drove to a quick intro by [Ben][2] from docker ([@bfirsh][2]) who explained that that was not yet-another-meetup but what he called an &#8220;OpenSource-a-thon&#8221;. The idea is to get around the table together and contribute to the Docker project. He emphasized that not only code contributions were welcomed, but all sorts of non-code contributions too.

I teamed up with the fine people of [Cloud66][3] trying to sort out the Documentation. We tried to complete [the Issue 11593][4], but we didn&#8217;t get too far. By the time we had set up the environment and started digging the code, it was time to wrap up.<img class=" size-medium wp-image-420 aligncenter" src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ben-docker-300x225.jpg" alt="ben-docker" width="300" height="225" />

Documentation is key to adoption. Unfortunately, code documentation is very hard unless you know the code very well. At this point I would encourage you, kind reader, to try to write a little about something that&#8217;s it&#8217;s itching you. There&#8217;s nothing like sitting down and starting to type (unless you have one of those funky standing desks, of course) to make you realise how hard is to write good documentation.[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-419" src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/stickers-docker-300x225.jpg" alt="stickers-docker" width="300" height="225" />][5]

Kudos from me to all the people writing documentation. Me and my children are very very pleased with your work. Keep it up!

Docker has a [Docker.party][6] website about the motivation behind the &#8220;_open-source-a-thon_&#8221; where they explain that they will donate $50 to the [Oceanic Society][7] for each contribution we submit during the birthday. You see? write some documentation, save a whale!

But wait, it&#8217;s not only during these events that your contributions can save a whale: from 23rd of March to 19th of April, all contributions made to the Docker Project will count toward Docker’s donation to the Oceanic Society **\o/**

I might spend some time finishing off that issue and to lead as example, I&#8217;m also happy to write a tutorial. I&#8217;ve been running Docker in production for almost a year now, I&#8217;ve built microservices, used Weave, and migrated dinosaurs (aka Big Enterprise Legacy Applications) to containers. So, I might say it&#8217;s safe to think I know a bit about how to use containers in real life scenarios.

[Fill this form][8] or  [Just let me know in Twitter][9] what kind of tutorial would you like to see and I will get my hands into it!

**Happy Birthday, Docker!**
