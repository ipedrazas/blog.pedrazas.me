In my last post I gave a few figures about how many installations, messages, and more. Between all those numbers there was this:

> 78 visits to the app page (78.71% from Twitter, 8.17% from Facebook, 0% from G+)

And this, my friends, it&#8217;s why you all should have the best communicators driving your corporate twitter accounts.

Ok, let&#8217;s be honest here. I really thought that Facebook would be 0 and that Google Plus would be closer to twitter&#8230; and I was wrong. Very wrong.

Google must be doing something very wrong to not driving traffic like that. 0%? that&#8217;s absolute rubbish!

Bear in mind that I posted to different G+ circles with, in total, thousands of people. Result: 0

I use Facebook ONLY for family and close friends&#8230; so, don&#8217;t get offended if I don&#8217;t know you very well and I don&#8217;t accept your facebook request&#8230; and now remember that me being Spanish and spaniards not mastering English it&#8217;s kind of foreseeable that not much traffic will come from Facebook&#8230; still, almost a 10% came from it.

Let me remind you that Thousands in G+ were trumped by a handful of Facebook friends, and completely smashed by Twitter. Google, you&#8217;re doing something very wrong.

Did we say Twitter? well, I have less than 400 followers, but I managed to get 78 clicks. 72 of which came from Twitter&#8230; So, 1 in 5 of my followers clicked my link. Will be good to know if this percentage scale but I&#8217;m afraid it will not, still 20% of my followers visiting the app page is awesome!

Thanks guys!

What can we learn from this? Twitter is a wicked for promotion. Forget Facebook, Ignore Google Plus. Tweet, Tweet, Tweet!

Anyone in the room fancy sharing their experiences?
