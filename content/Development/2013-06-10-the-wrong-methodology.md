Every project needs a team, and every project manager needs a methodology.

Let&#8217;s put it like this: I still haven&#8217;t found the methodology that illustrates my day-to-day life while building products.

We have agiles, we have scrums and ancient cascades, but let&#8217;s be honest&#8230; You pick one and then you adapt it to the requirements/needs of the project. Don&#8217;t get me wrong methodologies are important, and we all need a bit of guidance but in essence all methodologies are flawed because all of them part from a wrong caveat: We know what we&#8217;re doing.

The Wrong Methodology is an internal methodology I&#8217;ve been using and applying in the last projects I&#8217;ve been involved and it&#8217;s proving to be quite successful in forecasting what is going to happen.

The methodology is based in the assumption that anything you do it&#8217;s wrong. In essence is the TDD applied to business. Instead of saying &#8220;This is the data model&#8221; we say &#8220;This is the wrong data model&#8221; then we go and fix it.

This methodology is based in 2 principles:

  * <span style="line-height: 15px;">Assume you are wrong the first time you make a statement.</span>
  * Assume that nobody cares about that statement.

The first point helps with Ego based project and explicitly highlights something that our agile friends do very well: iterate, iterate, iterate. Defining a data model or a web navigation are the better examples of &#8220;we&#8217;re not going to make t right the first time&#8230; or the following 10&#8243;, but you can apply this point to meetings. Usually the PM would set up a meeting to discuss this or that. The joy of the Wrong Methodology applied to meetings is wicked. &#8220;The fact that you&#8217;re wrong is something that has very little impact in the business, but as it happens, the impact in the business of having a room full of people doing the wrong thing is just terrible&#8221;.

The second point has been very useful to decide priorities and build a &#8220;useful&#8221; roadmap. For example, we didn&#8217;t build the login functionality until our app had to behave different according to the person using it.

I will be writing a bit more about the Wrong Methodology in the following weeks and yes, I will be giving specific examples. Stay Tuned!
