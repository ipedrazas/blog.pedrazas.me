Programming and cooking are very similar. It has a bit of craft, a bit of technique, a bit of art and loads of hard work.

This is how I explained once how to make a mobile app using a pizza as example.

To make a pizza you can choose between different ingredients, but more or less they are pretty much the same. Now, people can combine these ingredients to make unique pizzas&#8230; but all of them are made of common ingredients: Dough for the base, tomato, ham, olives, cheese, oregano&#8230;

Apps are the same. Think of an app like Instagram or any that uses the cloud as a pizza. What do you need to make the Instagram Pizza?

Need a database to store all the data you app uses. You need a web interface that allows people to see their pictures. You need an API for that app to talk to your database&#8230;

So, what are your ingredients? the database, for example, Postgress, the language of the app is iOS, then you can choose a language for the backend and the web frontend or use the same. Let&#8217;s choose python, since that&#8217;s how instagram is done.

Ingredients to make the Instagram Pizza:

  * A well knuckled Postgress Database
  * 300 ml of well mixed Objective C
  * 700g of raw python, use 500g if you&#8217;re using Django
  * Dress your pizza with a nice gulp of beautifully designed artwork
  * Fine, now these ingredients are nothing special. You can make the Instagram Pizza or something completely different. For example, Google uses more or less the same ingredients for many of their cupcakes.

So, what it makes those ingredients to turn into a wonderful Pizza? of course, the chef and his team, and the chef is precisely the one who knows how to combine this ingredient with that one. Why you shouldn&#8217;t whisk the database that fast, or why timing the time and temperature the pizza stays in the oven is key for a great result (timing the time and speed of the uploading of your pictures, if you&#8217;re still thinking of Instagram)

The difference between a good pizza and a terrible one is not usually the ingredients. Of course, the quality of the ingredients it is important, but not the fact that you can have very different pizzas made with the same ingredients. The same way that you can have very different results using the same technologies, or the same stack.

So, how to knuckle the dough, how to combine the ingredients, when and for how long have to be in the oven and how to serve it. That&#8217;s where the difference is really made.

We don&#8217;t define a good cook because of the ingredients, we define a good cook because of the resources he uses to produce wonderful food beautifully cooked. The same way we don&#8217;t define a good programmer because of the language he knows or the stack that he uses&#8230; Oh, Wait!

Want to make a good pizza? choosing the right ingredients help, but it&#8217;s how you bake it what really will make your meal success or a failure.

Agree, there&#8217;s more than just the ingredients: the cooks, the place, the situation and &#8230; your friends, but let&#8217;s leave that for another post.
