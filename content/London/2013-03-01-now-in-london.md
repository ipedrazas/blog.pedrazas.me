London is HARD. That&#8217;s the message I always send to the Spaniards who ask me about coming to live and work to this city. London has far too many things to offer but there&#8217;s also a high price you have to pay (have you looked at the rental prices lately?).

But it&#8217;s not only money. London is expensive but so it is Barcelona or Paris.

What it really makes this city so special is the people (I know, I know, bear with me). The first difference young people notice with any other city is the incredible amount of young people who lives here. The second one is that many people come to London not to settle down, which makes this city the perfect place for flings, affairs and passionate one night stands.

But it&#8217;s not about how easy is to get laid in this city, ok, it is&#8230; O_0 and about work. I don&#8217;t  tweet job offers any more, at the end of the day, I&#8217;m not a recruiter but if you want to come to this city to find a job, let me know.

For example, while having coffee this morning a guy asked if I knew of a python developer looking for a job. Another guy spat out  &#8220;_Python developers don&#8217;t look for jobs, they all have jobs_&#8221; and we all laughed (we all do python and we all have jobs, so the guy was not that wrong, was he?)
