After a week near Barcelona where I tried not to write any code&#8230; I came back with a very diffuse idea of what should I do next. I knew what I wanted, I knew where I wanted to go, but I had no idea of the route.

Well, I&#8217;ve just got the green line from the financial team (read, my wife) to enrol in the next crazy idea: a mobile app for the wedding of a friend!

Come on, guys, after Saint Valentine, it was clear that it had to be a wedding&#8230; wasn&#8217;t it?
