Just after finishing the Mobile Apps. workshop for [QME][1] I started thinking of the follow up. I sent them off asking them to think about the idea so when we meet up again they can talk about it in complete confidence. A paper prototype would be ideal, but we shall see.

Anyway, there I was coming back in the tube and then I thought &#8220;**What if&#8230;** I do the same&#8221;. Of course, I&#8217;m extremely busy already so, the  idea of making yet-another-app was beyond sanity. Still, by the following morning I had made the (cruel) decision to design, build and release an app&#8230; in less than a week.

So, here&#8217;s the thing, I&#8217;m going to make an app under a week (and because I know myself quiet well) I&#8217;m going to release it before next Thursday. Not only that, I&#8217;ve made sure that there&#8217;s no much point of missing the deadline, because this app, my friends, it&#8217;s called &#8216;**My Secret Valentine**&#8220;.

As you can see, releasing a Valentine&#8217;s app on the 15th of Feb. is just idiotic. A classic example of Run or Die.

I did the paper prototype, in fact, I have 3 versions of the paper prototype (iterating it&#8217;s easier when you only have to scrap the paper and get a new fresh post-it).

Bear with me (and my new blog) I will posting updates pretty soon and yes, I will write about the whole process
