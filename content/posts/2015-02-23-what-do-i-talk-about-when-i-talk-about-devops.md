I&#8217;ve been in a few meetups already and I&#8217;ve seen people trying to explain &#8220;_what is this DevOps thing, anyway_&#8220;.

To DevOps you come from Dev&#8230; or from Ops, and that origin is quiet important, not because of what you know, but because how do you do things. Some people see DevOps like a fancy way of saying &#8220;sysadmins&#8221; (recruiters, I&#8217;m looking at you!!). Well, here are the bad news for recruiters: DevOps is more about Dev than Ops&#8230;

DevOps it&#8217;s about making life better for developers and sysadmins. DevOps it&#8217;s not about writing Jenkins job, DevOps is about changing the way your process work so you remove risk and friction from, for example, your Jenkins jobs.

I know, it&#8217;s very unclear&#8230; and I guess that&#8217;s why there&#8217;s so much talk about what it&#8217;s DevOps and what it&#8217;s not.

Because it&#8217;s not about the tools, it&#8217;s not about the process. It&#8217;s about how do we use those tools and implement those processes that creates friction. Talking about friction, DevOps it&#8217;s giving a small blanket to someone who wears chunky boots before throwing himself down a slide.

But why we have so many different definitions, then? because we are a mix and match group of people with a mix and match set of problems and a mix and match of tools in our toolboxes. Plenty of combinations, one objective: delivering.

So, there&#8217;s no silver bullet? I&#8217;m afraid not. The fact that you use Jira and Slack and Git doesn&#8217;t make you an Agile team. It certainly makes your life easier than using Subversion, emails and Microsoft Project, but the tools are not the team, the same way that the team is not the product.

DevOps is not about being a sysadmin, or a developer, it&#8217;s about being able to challenge and change processes and tools. The most important part of being a good DevOps engineer is not being a good developer or a very methodical sysadmin, it&#8217;s about having the vision and the guts to challenge the process, the tools and the teams.

Adding a sysadmin type of person to a group of developers will make that team better. The same way that adding a developer to a group of sysadmins. It&#8217;s about finding balance and complementing each other. It&#8217;s not about using Nagios, of Chef or writing Tests for how your infrastructure is created.

If you google successful DevOps stories you will find many different examples of how to improve. Some of them talk about using a set of tools that allowed them to shorten release times. Others, talk about reorganisations, another will explain how they managed to speed up the communication and feedback loops, or how did they reduce costs, or many others&#8230; The Objective is always the same: Improving you delivery. The pattern is clear: every single successful DevOps story had the opportunity to **challenge the Status Quo**.
