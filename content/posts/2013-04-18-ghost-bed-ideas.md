## Those thoughts that crawl around at midnight.

Was talking about ideas last week and suddenly I realised that my ideas don&#8217;t come from nothing but from a seed idea. Something that makes an impact or attracts my mind somehow triggers the idea generation process.

The process is more or less like this:

  * I see something I like, for example, the stool that rocks.
  * That sensation/memory lingers in y head for a while.
  * Start spawning random thoughts of how I would do if I were or what I would do if I could
  * A lot of side jumping between ideas.

Have you seen how designers work? designers produce and discard an extraordinary amount of work. My idea generation process is a bit like that. Hammering the concept with as many random thoughts as possible and looking at how the idea shapes up.

For example, using the stool that rocks I could talk about the **&#8220;Ghost Bed Idea&#8221;** which is nothing more that a design of a bed I&#8217;ve made based on the principles of the stool that rocks: that you can make your own furniture.

But can you? Can you really make your own table? bed? chairs?

I don&#8217;t see why not. Unfortunately for me, my cad skills are almost none, but I know how to draw, and yes I know how to do technical drawing too&#8230; and I&#8217;m not engineer but I know enough of tensions, forces and resistance to think of what it means to build something like a bed.

I don&#8217;t want to imagine my wife&#8217;s reaction next time she ask me what I&#8217;m doing: &#8220;Actually, a bed, darling&#8221;&#8230;

But let&#8217;s face it. For now, it&#8217;s more a concept, a few sketches and some random queries in google to find out how thick wood has to be to be able to build a bed.
