## How to explain geeky grown up things to children

There are times that you have to think fast. There are times you cannot think at all, like when my little boy asked me &#8220;Dad, what is the Internet?&#8221;

My answer then was not great, but I think I manage to send my message. It was something like &#8220;Imagine that the game you play in internet were a building. Imagine as well that the web pages you visit are buildings as well. YouTube? like the cinemas at Wetsfields. yes? He nodded so I took it as if he was following me&#8221;

&#8220;Well, if you can see all those websites like buildings, Internet are the roads and streets that take you from one to another. Then you have search engines like Google that are like the tube, that will take you to that far building down there but faster. Do you understand?&#8221;

&#8220;So&#8230; it&#8217;s not a place, it&#8217;s the way you go from one place to another?&#8221; &#8220;yup&#8221; &#8220;Oh&#8230; is it that why granddad calls it **The Information Highway**?&#8221;

Next time he asks me something like that I will direct him straight to my dad.
