I don&#8217;t usually talk about my children unless you&#8217;re a close friend. However, today I&#8217;m going to do an exception.

My oldest son is 11. I guess I&#8217;m not the only one who worries and wonders what will happen with his children when they grow up and have to face reality. Have my wife and I done a good job and prepare themselves to find their own way in life?

Questions, many questions&#8230; and finally, one answer!

Recently I bought a 3D printer. I&#8217;m a developer with -3 skills in 3D design&#8230; or almost any design, so there&#8217;s no way I can justify that the printer was a &#8220;work related&#8221; purchase.

Still, I love making things. The fact that at work people refers to me as the guy to fetch if you want things done will give you the insight that I will not sit idle in my chair&#8230; or any chair.[I don&#8217;t usually talk about my children unless you&#8217;re a close friend.

I will not talk about 3D printing here, I will talk about a side effect of having a 3D printer at home.

My children sees the printer as a wonderful toy generator machine&#8230; and I have to recognise that the little people have veritable passion for the plastic moulded stuff: look at their toys!

Anyway, to the point!

Yesterday my boy came to me with a list. He was looking at the list and mumbling some words when I asked what was the matter.

It was a list of names and words and numbers that made no sense at the beginning&#8230; then he explained his business idea to me:

&#8220;I&#8217;m going to sell toys at school, dad&#8230; and this is the list of the people who wants to buy things from me&#8221;.

Suddenly the odd list made sense:

It was the name of a child, the name of the toys and the price they had to pay for them.

&#8220;I&#8217;m going to get rich selling toys, dad&#8221;

I smiled and asked him if he had considered how much it cost to produce the toys and he looked at me puzzled:

&#8220;It&#8217;s free, dad!&#8221;

&#8220;Well, the fact that you don&#8217;t pay anything it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s free&#8221; (my mind drifted to all this web services that were supposedly free in exchange of &#8220;some&#8221; of your data&#8230;)

I tried to explain to him how he could calculate and how much he should charge for every toy&#8230; I could see he lost interest quickly &#8220;makes no sense, dad&#8230; I cannot put a different price to any toy, I will need two lists, one for my toys and one for the children&#8221;

Indeed you will need, my dear&#8230; That&#8217;s exactly how shops all over the world work. You have a list with stock and prices and a list of customers&#8230;

Conversation moved on and we left the little toy factory aside but when I went to bed I told my wife &#8220;darling, I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;re breeding Entrepreneurs&#8221; and last night, last night I slept well.
