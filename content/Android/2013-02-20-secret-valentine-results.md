Almost a week ago and I&#8217;ve said a word about My Secret Valentine project&#8230; yet. you will have to excuse me but I&#8217;ve been a bit busy. Things of having to deal with children during Half Term.

Let&#8217;s get into the story. Last week I published a very little app that the only thing that did was to send a (not very pretty, have to reckon) message and a picture by email.

Total numbers:

  * <span style="line-height: 15px;">30 installations in 7 countries (UK, Spain, USA, Ireland, Netherlands, Panama, Ukraine)</span>
  * 89 Valentines sent
  * 8 Uninstalls (after 14th of February)
  * 78 visits to the app page (78.71% from Twitter, 8.17% from Facebook, 0% from G+).

I used [Karmacrazy][1] to check how many people went to the Play page. In case you don&#8217;t know, Google doesn&#8217;t let you track how many people visit your app&#8217;s page. But as I said, no analytics? no problem. In fact, you can take a look to the link stats to see the kind of information you can get from this tool.

If you want to give it a go, use this [link][2].

More numbers. Android Versions. And this is kind of a surprise, because in the last Droidcon we talked loooong time about legacy android versions and here we have the proof of what&#8217;s the biggest problem with Android so far.

I fact, if we unify all the Jelly Bean devices we see that 75% of the devices are running Jelly Bean. However, who&#8217;s going to shut the door to 30% of their potential customers?

For those who are prone to slag Android think about it. Updates don&#8217;t come from Google, updates come from your carriers. The more the Android device has been customised, the harder it will be to update. Why so many devices still on 2.3.x ? because of the 24m contracts, of course.
