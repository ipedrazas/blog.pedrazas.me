Pictures, I need Pictures!

Ok, let me explain myself. Since Thursday I&#8217;ve been building a simple Android App for Saint Valentine. As original as I am, I called it &#8220;**My Secret Valentine**&#8221; but if you&#8217;re following this blog, you know already that.

The idea of the app is to be able to send a picture and a message to&#8230; your secret valentine!

Now, the app allows you to access your telephone gallery, so your valentine message can be as personal and intimate as you want.

As well, I had thought about putting a few pictures inside the app so people who are not that good photographers (even Instagram I guess will have loads to say about it) could send pretty messages as well.

Now, time is ticking, so, this is my call, could you be so kind to send me some beautifulÂ pictures so I can put them in my app?

If everything goes as expected, I&#8217;ll be putting the app in the market tomorrow&#8230; so, yes, time is REALLY ticking!

Btw, I can update the app at any moment, and I&#8217;m more than happy to add them at any point.

Oh, yes, one last thing. Your pictures have to have at least a copyleft license. And yes, I will be putting up a page with everybody who contributed to it.

Let me give you an example of a message sent from the app:

So, yes, if you want people sending their Valentines using one of your astonishing pictures, just get in contact with me.

  <strong>Happy Valentine&#8217;s Day!</strong>

**Disclaimer**: the app is free and open source and there are no revenue created by or from the app or images (nope, there are no adds neither), but the really good thing is all the stuff I&#8217;m going to write about it.
