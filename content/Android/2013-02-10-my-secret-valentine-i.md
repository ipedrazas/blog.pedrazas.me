Last Wednesday I spent 3 hours with QME trying to make them understand that one thing is having an idea, a very different thing is creating a product from that idea.

I got an idea: to make an app for Saint Valentine called &#8220;My Secret Valentine&#8221;. A simple app that allows you to send a message (an image and a text) to your valentine.

First step: accelerated idea iteration, where you basically get that idea, you throw it into the washing machine of your brain and try to spin it as much as possible. The result? a much polished idea.

Second step: paper prototype. I&#8217;m a big fan of paper prototype. I always draw diagrams, relationships, anything&#8230; ideas on paper are great because if you cannot put your idea on a paper, you don&#8217;t have an idea, you&#8217;re day dreaming.

Paper prototypes for apps are the best. Some post-its and a pencil it&#8217;s enough to bring your app to live. Once I have the Post-It app done, I use a mobile outline where I try to do the equivalent of a storyboard of my app.

Once I have that I start coding&#8230; but that part will be on another post.

Stay Tuned!
