This is Eclipse sluggishness is extremely obvious when you do Android development.

So, what have I done to minimise the impact of working in multiple projects at the same time?

Easy, I have two Eclipses: One for Java apps, and one for Android (I know, I know, there&#8217;s a new Android Studio coming, but let&#8217;s face it, in Ubuntu it doesn&#8217;t work&#8230; so until mighty Google sorts this out, I&#8217;ll stick to Eclipse).

Now, the problem of having different eclipses is that&#8230; the icon is the same and trust me, you will click the wrong one many times&#8230; and Eclipse is not the fastest app to load up.

Anyway, I found [here][2] a nice image to use as an Icon, however, the white background screamed quiet a lot once dropped in my lovely black gnome-shell.

I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m a good graphic designer, but it seems to work quiet well <img src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
