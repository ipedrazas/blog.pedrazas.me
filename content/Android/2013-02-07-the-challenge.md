Yesterday I spent a few hours talking with the Queen Mary Entrepreneurs students. My main objective was to motivate those ones who had and idea to try and build a product. I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;ve succeeded or not but while I was talking I had the idea of teaching by giving example&#8230; so, here&#8217;s the challenge.

Today it&#8217;s 7th of February, in a week it will be 14th&#8230; Saint Valentine&#8217;s day, so the challenge is to build an Android app that allows you to send a Secret Saint Valentine&#8217;s message.

I have a week to design, implement, test and release this app. Can I do it? well, using Bob the Builder catchphrase: &#8220;Yes, we can!&#8221;

The idea is simple, a person uses the app to send an anonymous message to his secret Valentine. I don&#8217;t really know how the person will receive the message. It will be by email but I&#8217;m not sure of the format yet.

Anyway, the whole point is to write a bit about the experience so next time I meet with the QME people, I&#8217;ll have some real data to share with them.

Wish me luck!
