This last week has been a bit crazy with all the new stuff that is going on but&#8230; if last week was mayhem, get ready because this week is hardware week.

Tomorrow I will go to the [London Hackspace][1] Â to see what do they do and **IF** it would make any sense to join them. I will unveil an idea that I&#8217;ve been working on for the last weeks. One of the things that I&#8217;ve learnt during these last 2 years is that no idea is good if no money can be made.

I agree that making money is &#8220;the business part&#8221; of the idea and I&#8217;ve been tempted to write a post about that in reply to a conversation that was triggered in Twitter by the fine people of Klicap. However, time is precious and &#8220;Talking is easy&#8221; so, my new motto is &#8220;**Make More, Talk Less**&#8221; (not that this many people are listening).

Super exciting times where I have to deal with Software and Hardware and the close relationship between them.

This pre-holidays week is all about hardware:

  * Arduino
  * Rapsberry Pis
  * NFC

And :blibb that we could say it&#8217;s the glue that ties them together. As I said&#8230; Exciting!
