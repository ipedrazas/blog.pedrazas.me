Last night it was the third Contain meetup. I was looking forward to seeing all the guys from RedHat, Microsoft and CoreOS and learning what was in store for us in the container space.

As it usually happens in life, things changed pretty quickly. Boris, the guy from Microsoft, had a car accident (rumours of him being in a Google self driving ca were discarded promptly). With Boris out, Matt asked me if I could be in the panel instead of him. I guess that Matt thought I was the perfect candidate to represent Microsoft since I am one of the few certified Windows Me power users (cough, cough).

Matt understands containers, that&#8217;s why he gave us the slides the proper way:

> **_docker run jetstack/contain:v3\_container\_os_**

The good news, to compensate the bad news of Boris car accident, was that Chris Kenyon, from Canonical came to talk to us about their plans with containers: <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/cloud/tools/lxd" target="_blank">LXD</a>

Chris told us during the panel that the datacenter now is following how mobile phones work. Updating hundreds or thousands of machines it&#8217;s equivalent to update thousands of telephones. Which is very interesting way of explaining transactional updates. Ubuntu, with snappy or CoreOS have that as the core of their value proposition.

It was an interesting conversation. I&#8217;m a big fan of immutable and ephemeral infrastructure. So when people ask me &#8220;_how do you update your containers_&#8221; the answer is simple: You don&#8217;t!

I think it&#8217;s good to differentiate when transactional updates are good and when they are not. Host updates: **yes**. Containers updates: **No**!

But what it&#8217;s fundamental is to understand that containers are not machines or VMs. You have to see your containers as snapshots. Immutable snapshots that can be easily discarded.

Forget about Chef, Puppet,Â Ansible or Salt

Updating containers have 2 parts: updating the image and running that container. Kubernetes is your friend here. It wasn&#8217;t until yesterday that I realised that many of my colleagues do not understand the great value of Kubernetes.

Updating containers is a matter of defining a new pod with your new containers and swapping the label when you are ready for the &#8220;update&#8221;. I guess that the best way of putting it is to say that Kubernetes does not try to solve the update problem because there&#8217;s no such problem in the kubernetes world. We have others&#8230; but that it&#8217;s not one of them.

In summary, an excellent night. Thanks <a href="http://www.jetstack.io/" target="_blank">Jetstack</a> and all the Matts involved!
