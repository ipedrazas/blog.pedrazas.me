<p>Monitoring is one of those things that yo should do: monitor EVERYTHING&#8230; or at least as much as you can.</p>

<p>One of the most slippery cases are our cron jobs. Many of them don&#8217;t report anything, many of them run without anyone knowing they&#8217;re there&#8230; And even worse, if they fail, they fail silently: as this cron job I disabled because it had been failing since 2008 (only 5 years or every day failures).</p>

<p>That was the last straw, after removing that entry from the crontab I went to my boss and we decided to tackle the problem. This client uses Nimbus but it seems that the Nimbus guy was not very happy on having loads of cron jobs added so I suggested using Jenkins.</p>

<p>In this case we decided to use Free Style Software Projects since they allow us to run the cron job manually</p>

<h1><a href="/2013/06/18/vagrant-second-round/.html">Vagrant, second round</a></h1>

<p>

<span class="label label-default">by ipedrazas</span>



<span class="label label-default">2013-06-18</span>



<a class="label label-success" href="/category/Development.html">Development</a>




<a class="label label-info" href="/tag/Development.html">Development</a>

<a class="label label-info" href="/tag/clinker.html">clinker</a>

<a class="label label-info" href="/tag/vagrant.html">vagrant</a>


</p>

<p><a href="http://www.vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> is made and brewed for developers by developers. The idea is to speed up and reduce friction as much as possible. It is not about building infrastructure, it&#8217;s about developing for that infrastructure.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is the take away lesson here: you don&#8217;t use Vagrant to replicate your production system, you use Vagrant to produce code to deploy to that production system.</p>

<p>In my case I used to have three environments: local dev, system test and production.</p>

<p>The problem with local dev is that it&#8217;s local&#8230; means only me (or whoever using my machine) can write code for it. When <a href="http://twitter.com/valgreens">Valgreens</a> joined <strong>:blibb</strong> we tried to build the system in his local machine but the task was painful and impossible (I work with ubuntu, he&#8217;s uses Mac, and trying to reproduce the whole thing was just not possible for me&#8230; using remote connections and yes, I accept my burden: we didn&#8217;t know enough).</p>

<p><strong>How Vagrant solved that problem?</strong></p>

<p>Well, we started by building a Vagrant box with what we needed: nginx, supervisor, mongodb, redis, php and zeroMQ. I configured the whole thing and re-package it. Move it to our web server and we install it from there. At that point both of us had the system ready to go. We cloned the git repo in the folder we had mapped in Vagrant and&#8230; that&#8217;s it, we had 2 systems running the latest code in 2 completely different architectures (if we can say that Mac and Linux are completely different&#8230;)</p>

<p><strong>How different is this to do the same with VmWare, for example?</strong></p>

<p>Well, Vagrant it&#8217;s not only the virtual machine or box, it&#8217;s all this little details, like that you can work in your own editor in your local system (but hey, it&#8217;s executed inside the vagrant box!).</p>

<p>Ok, let me say this again: you work in your local system with your editor and the code is saved and executed inside vagrant. No need for FTPs, no need for moving anything because Vagrant allows you to share any folder and remap it into the box as you want.</p>

<p>This is what the project folders look like:</p>

<pre>blibb-project
        Vagrantfile
        blibb-api/</pre>

<p>By default Vagrant maps the folder where you run Vagrant inside the box in /Vagrant and we configure nginx and gunicorn to create the virtualhost there.</p>

<p>The we had a couple of (handy) port mappings that allowed us to access MongoDB, gunicorn and the web server (localhost:27007, localhost:8001, localhost:8181)</p>

<p>That&#8217;s it, we wrote code locally, execute code inside vagrant, access the resources through localhost (no need to mess with the hosts files and fake ip/domains)&#8230; easy <img src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

<p>Developing is hard and since we started using Vagrant our productivity has sky rocketed. In this sense, there&#8217;s another product that I will recommend always: <a href="http://clinkerhq.com/">clinker</a>, a Development Ecosystem.</p>

<p>I will be writing soon about Clinker and how it has helped me out to get more time and lower my stress levels, in fact, these two products have made developing quite a rewarding experience. Both of them aim to the same pain point: Forget about system administration. <strong>Developers, develop!</strong></p>

</p>

<p>`So, imagine I would say that with this two commands:</p>

<p>`</p>

<p>You have a Virtual machine with Ubuntu ready to play with.</p>

<p>Now, imagine that you configure that machine with the different software that you need. Smart people call that action to provision your machines. Just imagine. Because you have plenty of space, you save that virtual box somewhere in your dev server.</p>

<p>(in case you wonder where that virtual machine, or box, has been stored, it&#8217;s here, look:</p>

<p><code>~/.vagrant.d/boxes/precise64/virtualbox/</code></p>

<p>happy, now?)</p>

<p>Now, imagine this Science Fiction scene: a new starter arrives and it takes longer to set up his email and domain user than the dev machine. I know&#8230; sounds ridiculous.</p>

<p>Well, that&#8217;s Vagrant.</p>

<p>I use Vagrant with <a href="http://www.ansibleworks.com/docs/playbooks2.html">Ansible</a> (we&#8217;ll talk about this in another post) to re-create a Dev environment. Last time we checked out, it took 4 minutes and 23 seconds to create, provision and deploy the code in Vagrant installing and configuring:</p>

<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 15px;">Nginx</span></li>
<li>php-fpm</li>
<li>python: gunicorn, supervisor, virtualenv</li>
<li>mongodb</li>
<li>redis</li>
</ul>

<p>Thing is, I much rather prefer spending time setting up my sublime text than my python environment&#8230; unfortunately, I do have yet-another script that installs &amp; configures my sublime.</p>

<p><code>gunicorn --log-level=debug -c gunicorn.conf hello:app</code></p>

<p>or if just &#8220;gunicorn hello:app&#8221; which is great, it couldn&#8217;t be more simple!</p>

<p>But&#8230; Imagine this scenario: we create 2 apps, one in Java, one in python, let&#8217;s say, using Flask (I could have said Django&#8230; but let&#8217;s keep it simple).</p>

<p>Now I have my BIG FAT SERVER where I have my tomcat instance and my gunicorn instance running.</p>

<ul>
<li>To deploy the java app I need to create a war file and upload it using the admin page&#8230; et voila, we have java app deployed.</li>
<li>To deploy the python app I need to ssh to that server, scp the python app files over, and run that line from above.</li>
</ul>

<p>Fair enough, it&#8217;s not that different and gunicorn kicks ass, but let&#8217;s be honest here, even if we had to ssh and copy over the war file&#8230; just by putting it in the right directory it will self-deploy. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I do love python and when I can, I much rather use python-gunicorn than any of their java cousins, but we have to be fair with the fat jvm relatives, haven&#8217;t we?</p>

<p>This time, Java wins!</p>

<h1><a href="/2013/06/10/the-wrong-methodology/.html">The Wrong Methodology</a></h1>

<p>

<span class="label label-default">by ipedrazas</span>



<span class="label label-default">2013-06-10</span>



<a class="label label-success" href="/category/Development.html">Development</a>



</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s put it like this: I still haven&#8217;t found the methodology that illustrates my day-to-day life while building products.</p>

<p>We have agiles, we have scrums and ancient cascades, but let&#8217;s be honest&#8230; You pick one and then you adapt it to the requirements/needs of the project. Don&#8217;t get me wrong methodologies are important, and we all need a bit of guidance but in essence all methodologies are flawed because all of them part from a wrong caveat: We know what we&#8217;re doing.</p>

<p>The Wrong Methodology is an internal methodology I&#8217;ve been using and applying in the last projects I&#8217;ve been involved and it&#8217;s proving to be quite successful in forecasting what is going to happen.</p>

<p>The methodology is based in the assumption that anything you do it&#8217;s wrong. In essence is the TDD applied to business. Instead of saying &#8220;This is the data model&#8221; we say &#8220;This is the wrong data model&#8221; then we go and fix it.</p>

<p>This methodology is based in 2 principles:</p>

<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 15px;">Assume you are wrong the first time you make a statement.</span></li>
<li>Assume that nobody cares about that statement.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first point helps with Ego based project and explicitly highlights something that our agile friends do very well: iterate, iterate, iterate. Defining a data model or a web navigation are the better examples of &#8220;we&#8217;re not going to make t right the first time&#8230; or the following 10&#8243;, but you can apply this point to meetings. Usually the PM would set up a meeting to discuss this or that. The joy of the Wrong Methodology applied to meetings is wicked. &#8220;The fact that you&#8217;re wrong is something that has very little impact in the business, but as it happens, the impact in the business of having a room full of people doing the wrong thing is just terrible&#8221;.</p>

<p>The second point has been very useful to decide priorities and build a &#8220;useful&#8221; roadmap. For example, we didn&#8217;t build the login functionality until our app had to behave different according to the person using it.</p>

<p>I will be writing a bit more about the Wrong Methodology in the following weeks and yes, I will be giving specific examples. Stay Tuned!</p>

</p>

<p>So, what have I done to minimise the impact of working in multiple projects at the same time?</p>

<p>Easy, I have two Eclipses: One for Java apps, and one for Android (I know, I know, there&#8217;s a new Android Studio coming, but let&#8217;s face it, in Ubuntu it doesn&#8217;t work&#8230; so until mighty Google sorts this out, I&#8217;ll stick to Eclipse).</p>

<p>Now, the problem of having different eclipses is that&#8230; the icon is the same and trust me, you will click the wrong one many times&#8230; and Eclipse is not the fastest app to load up.</p>

<p>Anyway, I found <a href="http://cmwolfe.blogspot.co.uk/2012/07/changing-icon-colors.html">here</a> a nice image to use as an Icon, however, the white background screamed quiet a lot once dropped in my lovely black gnome-shell.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m a good graphic designer, but it seems to work quiet well <img src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>

<p>This is how I explained once how to make a mobile app using a pizza as example.</p>

<p>To make a pizza you can choose between different ingredients, but more or less they are pretty much the same. Now, people can combine these ingredients to make unique pizzas&#8230; but all of them are made of common ingredients: Dough for the base, tomato, ham, olives, cheese, oregano&#8230;</p>

<p>Apps are the same. Think of an app like Instagram or any that uses the cloud as a pizza. What do you need to make the Instagram Pizza?</p>

<p>Need a database to store all the data you app uses. You need a web interface that allows people to see their pictures. You need an API for that app to talk to your database&#8230;</p>

<p>So, what are your ingredients? the database, for example, Postgress, the language of the app is iOS, then you can choose a language for the backend and the web frontend or use the same. Let&#8217;s choose python, since that&#8217;s how instagram is done.</p>

<p>Ingredients to make the Instagram Pizza:</p>

<ul>
<li>A well knuckled Postgress Database</li>
<li>300 ml of well mixed Objective C</li>
<li>700g of raw python, use 500g if you&#8217;re using Django</li>
<li>Dress your pizza with a nice gulp of beautifully designed artwork</li>
<li>Fine, now these ingredients are nothing special. You can make the Instagram Pizza or something completely different. For example, Google uses more or less the same ingredients for many of their cupcakes.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what it makes those ingredients to turn into a wonderful Pizza? of course, the chef and his team, and the chef is precisely the one who knows how to combine this ingredient with that one. Why you shouldn&#8217;t whisk the database that fast, or why timing the time and temperature the pizza stays in the oven is key for a great result (timing the time and speed of the uploading of your pictures, if you&#8217;re still thinking of Instagram)</p>

<p>The difference between a good pizza and a terrible one is not usually the ingredients. Of course, the quality of the ingredients it is important, but not the fact that you can have very different pizzas made with the same ingredients. The same way that you can have very different results using the same technologies, or the same stack.</p>

<p>So, how to knuckle the dough, how to combine the ingredients, when and for how long have to be in the oven and how to serve it. That&#8217;s where the difference is really made.</p>

<p>We don&#8217;t define a good cook because of the ingredients, we define a good cook because of the resources he uses to produce wonderful food beautifully cooked. The same way we don&#8217;t define a good programmer because of the language he knows or the stack that he uses&#8230; Oh, Wait!</p>

<p>Want to make a good pizza? choosing the right ingredients help, but it&#8217;s how you bake it what really will make your meal success or a failure.</p>

<p>Agree, there&#8217;s more than just the ingredients: the cooks, the place, the situation and &#8230; your friends, but let&#8217;s leave that for another post.</p>

</p>

<p>Was talking about ideas last week and suddenly I realised that my ideas don&#8217;t come from nothing but from a seed idea. Something that makes an impact or attracts my mind somehow triggers the idea generation process.</p>

<p>The process is more or less like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>I see something I like, for example, the stool that rocks.</li>
<li>That sensation/memory lingers in y head for a while.</li>
<li>Start spawning random thoughts of how I would do if I were or what I would do if I could</li>
<li>A lot of side jumping between ideas.</li>
</ul>

<p>Have you seen how designers work? designers produce and discard an extraordinary amount of work. My idea generation process is a bit like that. Hammering the concept with as many random thoughts as possible and looking at how the idea shapes up.</p>

<p>For example, using the stool that rocks I could talk about the <strong>&#8220;Ghost Bed Idea&#8221;</strong> which is nothing more that a design of a bed I&#8217;ve made based on the principles of the stool that rocks: that you can make your own furniture.</p>

<p>But can you? Can you really make your own table? bed? chairs?</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t see why not. Unfortunately for me, my cad skills are almost none, but I know how to draw, and yes I know how to do technical drawing too&#8230; and I&#8217;m not engineer but I know enough of tensions, forces and resistance to think of what it means to build something like a bed.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t want to imagine my wife&#8217;s reaction next time she ask me what I&#8217;m doing: &#8220;Actually, a bed, darling&#8221;&#8230;</p>

<p>But let&#8217;s face it. For now, it&#8217;s more a concept, a few sketches and some random queries in google to find out how thick wood has to be to be able to build a bed.</p>

<p>Offline is tough. In fact, in mobile, the ABC of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-AXTx4PcKI">this video</a> is turned into &#8220;Assume Bad Connectivity&#8221; and no matter what you&#8217;re building today, it has to work on mobile. Don&#8217;t get it wrong, I&#8217;m not saying make it mobile, I&#8217;m saying it has to work on mobile&#8230; and here is where I hit my wall: Offline.</p>

<p>There are different approaches, but basically the idea is that if you&#8217;re offline you use the web database (any of the many available now) and save your temporary data there until you get back online and you sync your data back.</p>

<p>That idea didn&#8217;t work out with me. It makes thing too complicated. having this approach means having to implement two set of APIs, one for local and one for remote, and chances of messing up are quiet high:</p>

<pre lang="javascript">if (online){
          getOnlineData();
          saveOnlineData();
          updateOnluneData();
          deleteOnlineData();
     }else{
          getOfflineData();
          saveOfflineData();
          updateOffluneData();
          deleteOfflineData();          
     }</pre>

<p>Will not help you much because you ever know when you are going to lose your connectivity. For us it worked much better this approach: you use always the local storage by default. Assume being offline always and sync whenever you have connection. Why? because it makes things easier and because it makes much more sense: your users don&#8217;t care about your server&#8230; nor your app, they care about their data.</p>

<pre lang="javascript">getOfflineData();
    saveOfflineData();
    updateOffluneData();
    deleteOfflineData(); 

    if (online){
          sync();
     }</pre>

<p>This approach makes development of the mini app much easier: you code against the local APIs and implement a Sync method that will sync changes in your server.</p>
