I&#8217;ve been waiting a loooong time before unleashing my (very reduced) arduino skills in order to build something wicked.

Arduino is great for learning and&#8230; for building THAT CRAZY IDEA.

First idea was about using solar energy with arduinos but since I work at night&#8230; I think I&#8217;ll have to postpone that one a little bit.

From all the arduinos the one that really ticks my box is the lilypad. Yup, the wearable arduino is the one I&#8217;ve been more willing to lay my hands on.

So, what is the project about?

Well, I like cycling and I like gadgets&#8230; and if there&#8217;s something that a bicycle doesn&#8217;t have is a proper signaling system, so this is my idea: A jacket that will have a signaling/messaging system.

I know, there are some projects already out there trying to achive having a more secure cycle ride, but they are not very usable.

My efforts are not making something that works. My efforts are aimed to build something usable. Something useful. Something beautiful.

So far I&#8217;m experimenting with arduino and the [Easy VR Shield][2]. The idea is very simple: you give voice commands to your jacket like &#8220;**RIGHT**&#8221; or &#8220;**LEFT**&#8221; and the jacket will light up a **<<** sign for a few seconds.

That&#8217;s what people would call an MVP, then, of course, there&#8217;s room for more fancy stuff like displaying messages to our fellow drivers&#8230; but this will come later, for now, let&#8217;s get the prototype working.

Anyway, I need to find a nice name for the project so, if you have a good idea for it, [share it with me][3], please <img src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />
