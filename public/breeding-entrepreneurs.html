<p>I don&#8217;t usually talk about my children unless you&#8217;re a close friend. However, today I&#8217;m going to do an exception.</p>

<p>My oldest son is 11. I guess I&#8217;m not the only one who worries and wonders what will happen with his children when they grow up and have to face reality. Have my wife and I done a good job and prepare themselves to find their own way in life?</p>

<p>Questions, many questions&#8230; and finally, one answer!</p>

<p>Recently I bought a 3D printer. I&#8217;m a developer with -3 skills in 3D design&#8230; or almost any design, so there&#8217;s no way I can justify that the printer was a &#8220;work related&#8221; purchase.</p>

<p>Still, I love making things. The fact that at work people refers to me as the guy to fetch if you want things done will give you the insight that I will not sit idle in my chair&#8230; or any chair.[I don&#8217;t usually talk about my children unless you&#8217;re a close friend.

<p>Still, I love making things. The fact that at work people refers to me as the guy to fetch if you want things done will give you the insight that I will not sit idle in my chair&#8230; or any chair.]<a href="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/photo-1.jpg">1</a></p>

<p>I will not talk about 3D printing here, I will talk about a side effect of having a 3D printer at home.</p>

<p>My children sees the printer as a wonderful toy generator machine&#8230; and I have to recognise that the little people have veritable passion for the plastic moulded stuff: look at their toys!</p>

<p>Anyway, to the point!</p>

<p>Yesterday my boy came to me with a list. He was looking at the list and mumbling some words when I asked what was the matter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/photo-1.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-200" alt="" src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/photo-1-225x300.jpg" width="225" height="300" /></a>He showed me that list. It was a list of names and words and numbers that made no sense at the beginning&#8230; then he explained his business idea to me:</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to sell toys at school, dad&#8230; and this is the list of the people who wants to buy things from me&#8221;.</p>

<p>Suddenly the odd list made sense:</p>

<p>It was the name of a child, the name of the toys and the price they had to pay for them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to get rich selling toys, dad&#8221;</p>

<p>I smiled and asked him if he had considered how much it cost to produce the toys and he looked at me puzzled:</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s free, dad!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, the fact that you don&#8217;t pay anything it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s free&#8221; (my mind drifted to all this web services that were supposedly free in exchange of &#8220;some&#8221; of your data&#8230;)</p>

<p><a href="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/minion.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-205" alt="minion" src="http://ivan.pedrazas.me/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/minion-300x225.jpg" width="300" height="225" /></a></p>

<p>I tried to explain to him how he could calculate and how much he should charge for every toy&#8230; I could see he lost interest quickly &#8220;makes no sense, dad&#8230; I cannot put a different price to any toy, I will need two lists, one for my toys and one for the children&#8221;</p>

<p>Indeed you will need, my dear&#8230; That&#8217;s exactly how shops all over the world work. You have a list with stock and prices and a list of customers&#8230;</p>

<p>Conversation moved on and we left the little toy factory aside but when I went to bed I told my wife &#8220;darling, I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;re breeding Entrepreneurs&#8221; and last night, last night I slept well.</p>
